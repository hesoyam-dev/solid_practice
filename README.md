# S - Single Responsibility principle
Each class should have only SINGLE responsibility!

# O - Open/Closed principle
Objects should be opened for extension and closed for modifications.

# L - Liskov Substitution principle
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

# I - Interface Segregation principle
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

# D - Dependency Inverstion principle
Abstractions shouldn't depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
